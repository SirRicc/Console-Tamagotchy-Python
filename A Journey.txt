A couple minuntes ago I completed my basic game which works like this:
-Give your Dog a name
-He gets older
-Nobody can feed him yet
-He gets older
-He dies from starvation

I need an interface to feed him! My first idea was to add an interact function onto the end my gameloop.
This interact function should take an input, check it against some preset values, may execute 
some code (while not pausing my gameloop) and continue. But as you might guess, - it paused.
