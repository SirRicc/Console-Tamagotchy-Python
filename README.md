# Console-Tamagotchy-Python
Welcome to my beginner project.
I want to create a basic Tamagotchy to practice some OOP.


# Status
Stuff's doin' what it should doin'.


# TODO:
-Daemonize threads so they shutdown when main thread exit.

-JSON
--When starting and savegame is found, load it & skip welcome()
--When exiting while this dog is alive, read a couple datas and write them into a file.

-Add a few more mechanics
--Walk your dog

# DONE:
